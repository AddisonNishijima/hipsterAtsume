----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tier 2:
combo: More hipsters, items etc? CHEESE HIPSTER is gone forever
combo: Rarity scale (Chance to get rich hipster?)(Heâ€™s shiny) (or Beard + glasses + hat: the uber hipster)(Portlandia-based hipsters/other hipsters that are references to things)

combo: Hipster Tracking - indication that you have collected all hipsters (or all hipsters for that environment)
frontend: Environment
backend: Resources (collected through hipsters that show up)
 - when you get a hipster, said hipster gives you 1-3 hipsterMonies, 2-5 hipsterMonies for rare hipsters (hipster giveMonies prototype)
 - hipstersMonies are used to buy stuff at the store (game, user monies property, item cost property)

 resources: part 2: THE RETURN OF THE SON OF THE MASK OF RESOURCES: THE RECKONING
 - getting rid of inventory will get you some monies back (half)
 - additional inventory rows (max - 8) = 20 hipstermonies (change inventory max) (display none initially and then display them)

Tier 3:
Multi-level resources (gold and silver hipstermonies)
Multiple environments! (similar to yard expansion/yard remodel) (carousel)
Certain items only available in certain environments
Hipster gifts (random chance when a hipster shows up?)

Tier Never:
Saving game state in local storage?
MULTIPLAYER ?!?!?! (lololol how) - race to get most hipsters


Wire-framing:

On page load, instructions appear with a new game button and disappear on new game button click (will have reset functionality and therefore needs an alert if they have a game in progress) (modal will continue to be accessible via something)

on modal close: show display grid and inventory initially (will have toggle ) users will see list of possible items and they can choose to enable or disable them (initially without restrictions).  After enabling an item they will be able to place it in the display grid (initially all items anywhere)

based on items, game/hipster object whatever figures out if a hipster will be enticed and if so, displays the hipster or a message of failure.  ON-screen tracker?

Player can try again - can clear display completely or manually disable and enable other stuff

Initially one hipster at a time
