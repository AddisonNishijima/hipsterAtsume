Wire-framing:

On page load, instructions appear with a new game button and disappear on new game button click (will have reset functionality and therefore needs an alert if they have a game in progress) (modal will continue to be accessible via something)

on modal close: show display grid and inventory initially (will have toggle ) users will see list of possible items and they can choose to enable or disable them (initially without restrictions).  After enabling an item they will be able to place it in the display grid (initially all items anywhere)

based on items, game/hipster object whatever figures out if a hipster will be enticed and if so, displays the hipster or a message of failure.  ON-screen tracker?

Player can try again - can clear display completely or manually disable and enable other stuff

Initially one hipster at a time
